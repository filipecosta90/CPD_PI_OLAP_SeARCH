We would like to thank our advisors for all the help they gave us and for always being available for all the questions
we had. 
We would also like to thank Rog\'erio Pontes for all the
help he gave us in understanding how the linear algebra theory would fit in OLAP, and all the time he spent helping us improve the parallel algorithms.
