\label{conclusion}

We have designed, implemented and evaluated an efficient and parallel LA framework to provide fast responses to OLAP queries in very large databases. We started by developing a typed linear algebra solution to respond to OLAP TPC-H query 1, with faster response times than a Open Source relational algebra competitor, PostgresSQL. 

A challenge in this project was to understand the linear algebra theory prior defined\cite{macedo2015linear} \cite{Po15}, to fully represent relational algebra in terms of linear algebra operators. This process was longstanding and it was only managed to do it with help of our advisors. Efforts were made to correctly introduce the key ideias prior presented\cite{macedo2015linear}, and resolving potential difficulties that the previous implementations faced. \par


%NÃO SEI O QUE O PROFESSOR QUER COM A LINHA AO LADO DESTE PARAGRAFO
In spite the already 18x speedup regarding sequential linear algebra version and the 2x speedup regarding the parallel relational algebra engine, a lot of work can be done to further improve the algorithm, and fully analyse TPC-H queries results, as stated on section \ref{future_work}, leaving several potential exploratory paths.
